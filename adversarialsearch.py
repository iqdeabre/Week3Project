    This function should:
    - search through the asp using alpha-beta pruning
    - cut off the search after cutoff_ply moves have been made.
 
    Input:
        asp - an AdversarialSearchProblem
        cutoff_ply - an Integer that determines when to cutoff the search and
            use heuristic_func. For example, when cutoff_ply = 1, use
            heuristic_func to evaluate states that result from your first move.
            When cutoff_ply = 2, use heuristic_func to evaluate states that
            result from your opponent's first move. When cutoff_ply = 3 use
            heuristic_func to evaluate the states that result from your second
            move. You may assume that cutoff_ply > 0.
        heuristic_func - a function that takes in a GameState and outputs a
            real number indicating how good that state is for the player who is
            using alpha_beta_cutoff to choose their action. You do not need to
            implement this function, as it should be provided by whomever is
            calling alpha_beta_cutoff, however you are welcome to write
            evaluation functions to test your implemention. The heuristic_func
            we provide does not handle terminal states, so evaluate terminal
            states the same way you evaluated them in the previous algorithms.
